## [v3.4.0] — 2026-06-12
### Service & Notifications Update

### Added
- `service install|uninstall|status` — run a profile as a login service with
  auto-reconnect: launchd user agent on macOS, systemd user unit on Linux.
  The service manager supervises openconnect in the foreground and restarts
  it if the tunnel drops (30s throttle). Preflight checks catch missing
  passwordless sudo, missing stored password, and passcode-2FA profiles.
- Desktop notifications on connect/disconnect/failure (macOS Notification
  Center via osascript, Linux via notify-send); new `NOTIFICATIONS` setting
  (default `TRUE`), prompted in setup and shown by `doctor`.
- Foreground sessions now record their own PID/state (openconnect only
  writes `--pid-file` when daemonizing), so `status` and `stop` work during
  foreground and service sessions too.

### Changed
- Service mode (`VPN_UP_SERVICE=1`) fails fast with clear errors instead of
  prompting: non-interactive `sudo -n`, stored-secret requirement, and a
  passcode-2FA guard.

## [v3.3.0] — 2026-06-12
### Profiles & Completion Update

### Added
- `add-profile` — guided profile creation: validates inputs, appends a
  well-formed `<VPN>` block, and optionally stores the password in the
  secrets backend and saves the gateway's certificate pin in one flow.
- Bash/zsh tab completion (`completions/vpn-up.bash`) for commands and
  profile names, including names with spaces.
- Per-profile PID, state, and log files — `status` reports every running
  connection, `stop [profile]` and `logs [-f] [profile]` target a specific
  one, and `logs` with no argument shows the most recent log.

### Changed
- Stale PID/state files are cleaned up automatically during `status`.
- One-connection-at-a-time policy is kept: `start` refuses while any VPN is
  running (the per-profile files make the bookkeeping accurate, not the
  tunnels concurrent).

---

## [v3.2.0] — 2026-06-12
### Scriptability & CLI Update

### Added
- `start [profile]` / `restart [profile]` — connect directly by profile name,
  no interactive menu; with a stored secret the only interaction left is 2FA.
- `list` — tabular overview of configured profiles (name, protocol, host,
  2FA method; no secrets shown).
- `logs [-f]` — show the connection log, or follow it live.
- `pin --save <profile>` — fetch the gateway's `pin-sha256` and write it into
  the profile's `<serverCertificate>` directly.
- Richer `status`: connected profile, gateway, connect time, and uptime
  (recorded in a state file at connect, removed on stop).

### Changed
- A `duo2FAMethod` of `passcode` now prompts for the one-time code at connect
  time instead of reading a stale value from the XML.

---

## [v3.1.0] — 2026-06-12
### UI Update

### Added
- `SHOW_BANNER` configuration setting (default `TRUE`) to control the
  start-up ASCII banner (PR #22).
- Setup wizard prompt for the banner preference; `doctor` includes
  `SHOW_BANNER` in its config preview (PR #22).
- ASCII banner displayed at the top of the README (PR #23).

### Changed
- `QUIET` now governs only openconnect's output verbosity; it no longer
  hides the banner. Existing configs without `SHOW_BANNER` default to
  showing it (PR #22).

## [v3.0.0] — 2026-06-12
### Security Hardening Release

### Breaking
- **Stored sudo password support removed.** Storing it defeated sudo's
  protection; use the scoped `sudoers.d` rule documented in the README for
  passwordless operation. Any previously stored sudo password is deleted on
  the next `setup`, and `set-secret` refuses `sudo_password`.
- **User state moved to `~/.config/vpn-up`** (config, profiles, secrets
  vault, logs, PID files) — override with `VPN_UP_HOME`/`XDG_CONFIG_HOME`.
  Legacy files in the in-repo `config/` directory migrate automatically on
  first run.
- **Server identity now fails closed**: without a `pin-sha256` pin in
  `<serverCertificate>`, the gateway certificate must validate against the
  system trust store. Legacy SHA1 pins still work but warn.

### Added
- `pin <host[:port]>` command — prints the gateway's RFC 7469 `pin-sha256`
  value and reports whether the certificate also chain-validates.
- CI: shellcheck, bats test suite (secret backends + profile parsing), and
  gitleaks secret scanning on every push/PR.
- `SECURITY.md` with reporting instructions and the security model.

### Fixed
- `stop` could never actually stop the VPN: it killed the root-owned
  openconnect process without sudo, then deleted the PID file anyway. Now
  `sudo kill` with PID-identity verification and a SIGKILL fallback.
- Stored secrets were unretrievable on the OpenSSL-vault and plain-file
  backends (keys contain `=`, which broke the field-based lookup).
- `delete-secret` on Linux was a silent no-op; now uses `secret-tool clear`.
- Empty profile fields (e.g. a blanked `<password>`) shifted every following
  field during XML parsing.
- The shell hung forever after a successful background-mode connect (the
  daemonized child kept the log pipe open).
- openconnect's stderr was not captured in the log, and the log was created
  root-owned.
- A wrong vault passphrase silently re-encrypted an empty vault (data loss);
  it now aborts.

### Security
- Plaintext `<password>` values are blanked in the profile XML after
  migration to the secrets backend; the field is deprecated.
- Secrets no longer enter child-process environments or appear on command
  lines (process table); vault contents never touch disk decrypted.
- The config file is only sourced if owned by the current user and not
  group/world-writable; data files are created `600`, directories `700`.
- Leaked credentials were purged from the published git history; GitHub
  secret scanning and push protection are enabled on the repository.

## [v2.0.0] — 2025-12-16
### Secure & Modern Bash Release

### Added
- Secure secrets management using:
  - macOS **Keychain**
  - Linux **Secret Service**
  - OpenSSL-encrypted vault fallback (AES-256-CBC + PBKDF2)
- Interactive setup wizard (`setup`)
- Secrets management commands:
  - `set-secret`
  - `delete-secret`
- Environment diagnostics command (`doctor`)
- Bash version guard (requires **Bash ≥ 4**)
- Modular architecture (`core`, `profiles`, `encryption`, `ui`, etc.)
- Duo 2FA support:
  - `push`, `phone`, `sms`, or 6-digit passcode
  - Empty 2FA field allows gateway auto-push
- Optional secure storage of sudo password (`__GLOBAL__.sudo_password`)

### Changed
- OpenConnect execution now uses **argv arrays** (no `eval`)
- AuthGroup (`--authgroup`) is passed before stdin authentication
- Profile XML parsing now supports both legacy and modern tags:
  - `username | user`
  - `group | authGroup`
  - `duo2FAMethod | duoMethod`
- Plaintext passwords in profiles are automatically migrated to secure storage
- UI banner rendering isolated in `ui.sh` and shown only when interactive

### Fixed
- Authentication failures caused by AuthGroup prompts consuming password input
- Duo 2FA input being misinterpreted as AuthGroup selection
- Quoting and injection issues from `eval`
- Inconsistent behavior across macOS and Linux
- Bash 3.2 incompatibilities on macOS

### Security
- Passwords are **never stored in plaintext**
- `ENCRYPTION_KEY` configuration is intentionally ignored to avoid insecure key storage
- Secrets are always retrieved from OS-level secure storage when available

### Known Issues
- Some AnyConnect gateways emit an initial “Unexpected 404” banner; this is benign if the connection proceeds successfully
